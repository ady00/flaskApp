# flaskApp
Application to sort movies using IMDB's top ~1000 movies dataset using a variety of algorithms. Frontend made using React, backend made using the Flask framework. 

**To deploy this, you'll need to manually download and insert IMDB's dataset as it is far too large to fit in this repository.
